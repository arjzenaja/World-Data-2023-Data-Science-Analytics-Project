# World Data 2023 Data Science Analytics Project

This project is a comprehensive data science case study focused on uncovering patterns and insights from global country-level data across various social, economic, and environmental indicators. Conducted as part of a collaborative learning initiative with Dibimbing, the project leverages the World Data 2023 dataset from Kaggle, covering 195 countries with 35 diverse attributes.

Using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project walks through the entire analytical workflow â€” from data cleaning and preprocessing, to exploratory data analysis (EDA), insightful visualizations, and correlation exploration. The primary goal is to understand the factors associated with economic development, quality of life, and global socio-political dynamics.

The insights derived from this analysis can empower policymakers, economists, researchers, and international organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions and benchmark performance across countries in various development domains.
